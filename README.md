# 🧩 2048 Game 

A fully interactive, responsive, and pixel-perfect implementation of the famous **2048 puzzle game**. Built from scratch using modern Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+ Class architecture), object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, and semantic component design.

## Game Rules & Mechanics

The game is played on a smooth **4 × 4 grid** using your keyboard arrow keys:
* **Movement:** When a direction is chosen, all numbered tiles slide as far as they can in that direction.
* **Merging:** Two tiles of the same number collide and merge into a single tile with a doubled value (e.g., $2 + 2 \rightarrow 4$).
* **Mathematical Restriction:** A tile cannot be merged more than once during a single turn.
* **Random Spawning:** After every successful move, a new tile randomly spawns in an empty cell. It has a $90\%$ chance of being a **2** and a $10\%$ chance of being a **4**.
* **Scoring:** Your score increases dynamically by the exact sum of all combined tiles during that turn.
* **Win Condition:** The game triggers a victory screen as soon as a **2048** tile is achieved.
* **Game Over:** Triggers automatically when the board is completely full and no valid adjacent merges remain.

## Architecture & Codebase Design

The project is strictly separated into two distinct layers (following decoupled UI/Logic principles):

1. **Core Logic Engine (`Game.class.js`):**
   A stateful, framework-agnostic JavaScript class that completely handles data structures, board state array transformations, merge vectors, probability matrix calculation, and win/loss assertions.
2. **UI & Event Management Layer (`main.js`):**
   Directs raw DOM manipulation, keydown event handlers, dynamic class rendering (`field-cell--%value%`), screen state management (start, restart, modulations), and modal injections.

### Obligatory API Specifications:
* `constructor(initialState)` — Instantiates core properties with optional predefined matrix states.
* `getState()` / `getScore()` / `getStatus()` — Public getter APIs ensuring decoupled data tracking.
* `moveLeft()` / `moveRight()` / `moveUp()` / `moveDown()` — Structural grid translation algorithms.
* `start()` / `restart()` — State reset configurations.
